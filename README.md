Capstone Project

Idea: find the ultimate video!
Pitch: users can upload their favorite youtube videos into the video database, then other members can then upvote or downvote the video! is your video the best? lets find out! if your video gets -2 votes it will be deleted forever from the database. Only one can hold the top video? will it be you??

MVP:

- A register/login page
- A video page where user can use arrow keys to scroll page to next/previous videos or upvote/downvote video
- A comment section on video page where username will be displayed next to users comment, as well as a upvote/downvote system ranking the comments top down.
- An algorithm that deletes a video or comment if the votes reach -2
- A page which will display all videos ranked from most upvotes to least upvotes, the video with the most upvotes will be ranked king superior and have a crown emoji
- A page which allows the user to add a video into the videos database
- Website will be hosted on Heroku and accessable to everyone

Future Features:

- implement an algorithm which will make video selection only display videos user has not already seen
- possible api to start the website off with starter videos
- User can see total upvotes they have received (downvotes will subtract from the users total votes)
- User can spend their upvotes to gain access to special emoji's or backgrounds for the website
